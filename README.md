# üóÉÔ∏è Data-Warehouse Project

This project showcase an complete data warehousing and analytics solution from building a data warehouse to extract meaningful insights. Designed as industry best practices in data engineering and analytics

##  Data Architecture

This project follows the Medallion Architecture, organizing data into three layers:

1. **Bronze** Layer: Stores raw data directly from source systems. In this project, data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database..
2. **Silver Layer**: Performs data cleansing, standardization, and normalization, ensuring the data is structured and ready for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Contains business-ready data modeled into a star schema, optimized for reporting and analytics.

## Project Overview
This project involves:
1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## Project Requirements
#### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering) ####
#### Objective ####
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications ####
#### Data Pipeline Overview  ####

- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (**ERP** and **CRM**) provided as CSV files.  
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues before analysis.  
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model optimized for analytical queries.  
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.  
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.  


## BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)
#### Objective ####
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**  
- **Product Performance**  
- **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
